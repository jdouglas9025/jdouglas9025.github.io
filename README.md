# Jacob's Programming Portfolio

Howdy!

Welcome to my programming portfolio! My name is Jacob, and Iâ€™m an aspiring software engineer with a passion for
cybersecurity.
I'm currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Georgia. I've also recently applied to Georgia
Tech's online
M.S. in Computer Science for Fall 2024 admission.

I originally earned a B.B.A. in Management Information Systems with an emphasis in Information Security, but I decided
to return to university to expand my computer science knowledge
and position myself towards a technical career path. Before returning to university, I worked as a cybersecurity analyst
in the IAM field for
Deloitte for a year.

Thanks for stopping by,

Jacob Douglas
