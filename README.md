# Jacob's Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio! My name is Jacob, and Iâ€™m an upcoming university graduate with a passion for cybersecurity.
I'm currently wrapping up a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Georgia, and I'm seeking full-time opportunities starting early 2025.

I originally earned a B.B.A. in Management Information Systems with an emphasis in Information
Security, but I decided to continue my university studies to expand my CS knowledge and position myself towards a
technical career path.

Before returning to university, I worked as a cybersecurity analyst in the IAM field for Deloitte for a year. 
Currently, I'm performing part-time contract work for DataAnnotation as a software developer, helping train their AI models with respect to programming.

Thanks for stopping by,

Jacob Douglas
