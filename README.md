# Jacob's Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio! My name is Jacob, and Iâ€™m an aspiring engineer with a passion for cybersecurity.
I'm currently wrapping up a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Georgia, and I'm seeking full-time opportunities starting January 2025.

I originally earned a B.B.A. in Management Information Systems with an emphasis in Information Security, but I decided
to return to university to expand my computer science knowledge
and position myself towards a technical career path. Before returning to university, I worked as a cybersecurity analyst
in the IAM field for
Deloitte for a year.

Thanks for stopping by,

Jacob Douglas
